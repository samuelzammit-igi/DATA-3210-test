-- TODO: check if correct:
--          we assume that within a group, each categorical variable has the
--          same value throughout
--          we could use a CTE/partition to select the first one
--          (https://stackoverflow.com/a/3800572)
--          but MAX should work just fine to return that value, as there is no
--          order since all values are equal
